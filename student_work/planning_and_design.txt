Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step
* Identify which icons you are going to use and get the unicode for those icons
* Determine your board size
* Determine your scoring system
* Determine win / lose conditions
* Outline expansion ideas

Game Idea:
Classic Pacman. Player will control pacman to eat all pellets and avoid
touching the ghosts. Will not include the special pellet that lets you
eat ghosts.

Game Rules:
Path is created with barriers the player and ghosts cannot move through. 
Ghosts move randomly/independently.
Player presses WASD to move pacman, when he runs into a pellet it dissapears
and a point is added to score. 
When all pellets are collected the game ends and player wins. 
If you get eaten by a ghost you die, pacman dissapears, you respawn back at 
original spawning point, & 1 of three lives dissapears. All 3 run out, game ends
and you can restart the whole thing.

Major Game Elements:
ghost icon: U+1F47B
pacman normal moving icon: U+1F63C
pacman eating pellet icon: U+1F638
pacman dying icon: U+1F640

wall icon: U+1F9CD	(using the man standing emoji cause that's funny)

Board size: 10 by 10

Scoring System: 
-initialize score variable = 0
-start function, take pacman and pellet as arguments,
-detect that if pacman_touches_object(pacman, pellet): then 1 is += to global score variable.
-and also pellet is removed from the screen, pellet number is -= by 1.
-print score change
-death: 3 lives, if hits the enemies = -1 live. 
--Win and lose--
-if pellet number = 0, game = win.
