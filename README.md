# Python Game Project Requirements

## Goal
Create a playable Python game (examples: Snake, Pac-Man, survival game, or your own idea) that demonstrates lists, loops, functions, and organized data.

Your game does **NOT** need to look like any example game, but it must meet the requirements below.

---

## Required Features

Your project must include **all** of the following:

### 1. Data Organization
- Use **at least one dictionary** to manage game data  
  (examples: player stats, game state, enemies, score, settings).

### 2. Lists & Traversal
- Use **at least one list** to store multiple game objects.
- Use a **loop** to traverse the list and affect gameplay  
  (examples: checking collisions, updating enemies, collecting items).

### 3. Functions
- Write **at least 5 functions**.
- Each function should have a clear purpose (drawing, movement, logic, etc.).

### 4. Return Values
- At least one function must use `return` to control game logic  
  (example: movement success, collision result, game state change).

### 5. Game Mechanics
Your game must be playable and include:
- Player controls
- A game loop (runs continuously)
- A scoring, health, or progression system
- A win **or** lose condition

### 6. Code Quality
- Clear variable and function names
- Reasonable formatting and organization
- Comments explaining important logic
